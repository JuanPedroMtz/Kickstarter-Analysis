# Kickstarer-Analysis
Here are presented the results of the Module 1 of the Bootcamp Data Analysis and Visualization 

## Overview of the project
Louise developed a play in which it came close to its fundraising goals in a short amount of time. For next ocassions, Louise wants to be prepared to offer the peoples something that will help her to achieve the fundraising goals. That is why she wants our help to get the data, in order to visualize the behaviour of different events according to the differences each one of them has, such as launch dates and funding goals. 

## Analysis and Challenges 

  ### Analysis  
With the learnings obtained from the Bootcamp with managed the primarly data in order to get useful, coherent, and legible insights. 

To make a good analysis for Louise, first we had to organize the data from the database and presented in a way that would be easier to visualize it. We had to create new columns to separate data that would be hard to read it if it would stick together. Then we used tools mentioned in the Bootcamp that will help Louise to understand, easier, the information she has. We used Pivot Tables and some formulas that help us to obtain information that had certain parameters. 

With these information we obtained graphs that represent the data and the insight that we were looking for in order to help Louise.

With these lineal graphs, we will obtain the results and the insights that are going to be presented to Louise. 

  ### Challenges
 The challenges of this module came with the formulas. Because I had many mistakes that I had to review over and over again in order to find the correct solution. 
 
 ## Results
  ### What are two conclusions you can draw about the Theater Outcomes by Launch Date?
  1. Theater that have launch date on May are more common to succesful
  2. The theaters that have launch date on December have almost the same number of succesful and failed

  ### What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
  1. The plays that have $40,000 or more on goals, should be reduced, because the results show us that nearly none of them were accomplish. 

  ### What are some limitations of this dataset?
  I still donÂ´t see that the dataset has limitations
  
  ### What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
  1. Avg. Danation per category/subcategory
  2. Pledged according to the time (launched-end) of the event
  3. Favorite events per country
